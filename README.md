# hhvm-mssql


A Base Extension for creating an MSSQL extension for HHVM that supports the functions found at: http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/book.mssql.php


I don't have loads of free time right now and my C++ is rusty so would appreciate any help with this.
My initial aim is to create a skeleton plugin that reflects the current PHP API.
